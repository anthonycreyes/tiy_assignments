#My First Blog Post

This is my first blog entry talking about my time at the Iron Yard. I came to the Iron Yard to enchance my skillset in UI Design. With that I knew that I would be challenged to learn new skills that I have had trouble with in the past like HTML and CSS. I have to say after a few weeks of being here I have learning more than I have in the past when I have attempted to learn on my own.

There is something about the community here that pushes you to become better than you thought was possible. The students in my cohort are all very supporitive and we all encourage each other if we can't seem to figure out how things work. The environment is very condusive to learning...except the whole freezing room! 

There is so much more to say but due to time contraints I am going to say that I am happy with my time in the class so far. I know there is still so much to learn and I look forward to what is to come over the next few months. Now if they would only fix the AC in the room!!
